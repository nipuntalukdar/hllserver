hllserver
=========
A high-performance hyperlog server
----------------------------------

Hllserver implements hyperlog and hyperlog++ algortithms and makes the service available over the
network. It is useful for getting nearly distinct-count for high-cardinality metrices.

The service is available over thrift as well as over http and so writing a client in most of the
languages is dirt simple.

It's a work in progress.
